in order to apply the CSS to the HTML document, we need to link it in the head:

<link href="styles.style.css" rel"stylesheet" />

each collection of properties is referred to as a ruleset, or sometimes just as a rule. it is composed by the selector (the HTML element name we are referring to), the declaration (the property and the property value):

p {
  color: red;
}


SELECTING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS:

p,
li,
h1 {
  color: red;
}

DIFFERENT TYPES OF SELECTORS

	element selector: all HTML elements of the specified type eg: p (selects all <p>)

	ID selector: the element on the page with the specified ID. each ID  eg: #my-id (selects <p id="my-id"> or <a id="my-id">)

	class selector: the elements on the page with the specified class eg: .my-class (selects <p class="my-class"> and <a class="my-class">)

	attribute selector: the elements on the page with the specified attribute eg: img[src] (selects <img src="myimage.png"> but not <img>)

	pseudo-class selector: the specified element(s), but only when in the specified state eg: a:hover (selects <a> but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link)


and many more.


FONTS AND TEXT


to use fonts from google fonts, we first need to link the google fonts output in the HTML head:

<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans"
  rel="stylesheet" />

once we have this, we can use the font family in CSS rules:

html {
  font-size: 10px; /*the base font size is 10px high*/
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; /*this should be the rest of the output from google fonts*/
}



BOXES

padding: the space around the content

border: the solid line that is just outside the padding

margin: the space outside of the border

when setting two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the top and bottom size, while the second affects the left and right size. when using four values the order is: top, right, bottom, left (clockwise).
