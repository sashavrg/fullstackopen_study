attributes are contained in the opening tag <p class="editor note">My cat is very grumpy."</p>

attributes that set a value always have:

	1. A space between it and the element name
	2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign
	3. The attribute value wrapped by quotation marks ""

it's possible to nest elements inside other elements <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>

VOID ELEMENTS

some elements cannot have content or nested elements; these are called VOID ELEMENTS. one example is the <img> element:

<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
